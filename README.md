# 🧠 Generative AI Resources Hub

Welcome to my **Generative AI** repo — a personally curated collection of the *best, most practical* resources around GenAI, collected from across GitHub, papers, blog posts, and more.

This is **not another AI list.**
This is *my lab*. My go-to vault of tools, guides, models, and everything else that I personally found valuable while diving deep into the GenAI world.


## 📦 What’s Inside?

* 🔗 Repos & tools for LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)
* 🎨 Diffusion models & image generation (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney-style)
* 🧪 Prompt engineering examples
* 🧠 Fine-tuning & embeddings
* 🔧 APIs, SDKs, model hosting options
* 📄 Best papers, blog posts, courses
* 🛠️ Real-world use case demos


## 🧭 Why this repo?

There are *way too many* AI resources out there.
Most are either:

* too basic
* too scattered
* outdated
  So I’ve **curated the good stuff only** — things I’d bookmark or reuse in real projects.

> Think of this repo as a **personal wiki** for Generative AI.


## 🚧 Work In Progress

This is just the beginning.
More tools, breakdowns, and project references will keep getting added as I explore deeper.


## 🙋‍♂️ Who made this?
